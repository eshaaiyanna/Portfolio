# Hi, I'm Esha! 


## About Me
 I have a background in Android Quality Assurance, and I’m eager to transition into the field of data. My experience in QA has equipped me with a strong attention to detail and an analytical mindset, which I believe are essential skills for working with data.

During my career, I’ve developed a solid understanding of testing processes and methodologies, which has fostered my passion for data analysis and insights. I’m excited to leverage my technical skills and keen eye for detail to uncover valuable information in data.

In my free time, I enjoy learning about data analysis tools and techniques, and I’m always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I’m driven by the excitement of discovering new insights and using data to solve complex challenges.

## Portfolio Projects:
#### **Algorithmic Trading Strategy**

**Code**: [Algorithmic Trading.py](https://github.com/eshaaiyanna/Portfolio/blob/main/Algorithmic%20Trading.py)

**Goal:** Implement an Algorithm Trading strategy known as the momentum strategy on stock price data using Python.

**Description:** This project explores algorithmic trading using Momentum and Moving Average strategies, alongside CAGR analysis. It visualizes closing prices, momentum indicators, and moving averages, highlighting buy and sell signals. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data analysis, Moving averages, Data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly.

**Results:** The goal is to evaluate trading performance and provide insights into investment growth over time based on historical data.

#### **AB Testing**
**Code:** [AB Testing.py](https://github.com/eshaaiyanna/Portfolio/blob/main/AB%20Testing.py)

**Description:** The dataset contains two data files about two marketing campaigns (Control Campaign and Test Campaign) with two different marketing strategies for the same goal .The project focuses on identifying the optimal marketing strategy by analyzing and comparing the performance of both campaigns

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data analysis, Data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Plotly.

**Results:** Control campaign resulted in more sales and engagement from the visitors. More products were viewed from the control campaign, resulting in more products in the cart and more sales. But the conversation rate of products in the cart is higher in the test campaign.

#### **Store Sales Analysis**

**Code:** [Store Sales.ipynb](https://github.com/eshaaiyanna/Portfolio/blob/main/Store%20sales.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records. The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data analysis, Data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items.

#### **Interactive Chatbot**

**Code:** [Chatbot.py](https://github.com/eshaaiyanna/Portfolio/blob/main/Chatbot/app.py)

**Description:**
Developed a conversational AI chatbot with Flask, utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for dynamic and contextually relevant interactions. Integrated SQLAlchemy for seamless database management, designing a scalable schema in PostgreSQL to store user interactions. 

**Skills:** API integration,Git commands,Data analysis,Problem solving

**Technology:** Flask,OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo,SQLAlchemy,PostgreSQL

**Results:** Ensured a smooth user experience by aligning frontend and backend functionalities. Conducted in-depth analysis of session data using SQL to evaluate conversation patterns, response times, and user engagement metrics.
