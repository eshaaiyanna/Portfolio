Hi, I’m Esha! I have a background in Android Quality Assurance, and I’m eager to transition into the field of data. My experience in QA has equipped me with a strong attention to detail and an analytical mindset, which I believe are essential skills for working with data.

During my career, I’ve developed a solid understanding of testing processes and methodologies, which has fostered my passion for data analysis and insights. I’m excited to leverage my technical skills and keen eye for detail to uncover valuable information in data.

In my free time, I enjoy learning about data analysis tools and techniques, and I’m always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I’m driven by the excitement of discovering new insights and using data to solve complex challenges.
